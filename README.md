While working with people, I noticed that there were so many plugins/tools that charged people just for the number of form submissions they'd receive. I always like looking at things from a cost efficiency point of view, so I did some research and figured out a way to integrate a Google Script that sends all form fields to a Google Excel sheet, for FREE!
